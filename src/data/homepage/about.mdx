Hi, I'm Blair Wilcox! I'm a frontend developer and design technologist living in Boston, Massachusetts. I've worked on all sorts of projects during my time in the industry ranging from frontend to backend development, with technology as varied as chrome extensions and Figma plugins. At the end of the day, I like working on tools that make people's lives a little bit easier.
