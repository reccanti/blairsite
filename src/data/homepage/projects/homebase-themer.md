A Figma plugin initially extending [Themer](https://github.com/thomas-lowry/themer), but gradually updated to support additional token types, a React UI built with our design system components, and analytics using Wayfairâ€™s internal tracking system.

This plugin was needed for the Homebase team to migrate from Sketch to Figma. I was in charge of the initial investigation and implementation, and led subsequent maintenance and feature development. As a result of adopting this plugin, we were able to maintain 3 times as many themes using 1/3 of the assets.

You can read more about the development and use of this plugin in [this Medium blog post](https://medium.com/wayfair-design/design-infrastructure-engineering-at-wayfair-a78df89fa075).
