Homebase is a UI library used internally at Wayfair across itâ€™s web, Android, and iOS apps. I mostly focused on the web library, which was written in React, and the related Figma assets. Tasks usually involved making technical changes to ensure the components were accessible and bug-free, and working with the design team to evaluate new components and variants of those components. We maintained an extensive testing setup for this library, using Jest for unit tests, Cypress for integration tests, and Chromatic for Visual Regression tests. We also maintained a regular release cadence of a new version every 2 weeks, alternating the responsibility among team members.
