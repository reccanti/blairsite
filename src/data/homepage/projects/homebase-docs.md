A NextJS website that was used internally at Wayfair to document how to use the Homebase UI library. It hosted live demos of Homebase components, design and accessibility guidelines, information on how to setup the libraries and related tooling, and a sandbox where people could test out the components and prototype layouts. In addition to doing frontend and backend web development on the site, we also were in charge of deploying this site through Google Cloud Platform, which required knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, Buildkite, and Terraform.
