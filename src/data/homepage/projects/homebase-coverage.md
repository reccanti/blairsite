A browser extension used internally at Wayfair to measure the proportion of Homebase components on a page. This was used by other teams at Wayfair to measure their compliance with our design system. I did the initial development, researching how to develop and publish a Chrome extension and implementing it in TypeScript (one of the first major projects on the Homebase team to use it).
