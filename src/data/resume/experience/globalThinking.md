Worked as a software engineering intern for Global Thinking (now [More Vang](https://morevang.com/)), a design firm specializing in print and digital marketing campaigns. I worked on an agile team of 5-6 developers developing personalized **Wordpress** sites and implementing new features for their **Laravel** web app, Mythos, and **Magento** ecommerce platform.
