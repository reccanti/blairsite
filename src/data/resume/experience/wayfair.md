Began by working as a Frontend Developer on Wayfair's Product Detail Page (PDP), and later became a Frontend Engineer and Design Technologist for Wayfair's Homebase Design System. On PDP, I worked with an integrated team of developers, designers, QA testers, and analysts to add features and A/B test new layouts. Features were developed with **React**, **Redux**, and **SCSS** with a **PHP** backend and **GraphQL** APIs.

On the Homebase team, I worked with an extended team of developers and designers to maintain the Homebase design system's web components (written in **React** and **TypeScript**) and design components (made with **Figma**). I did a lot of work on tooling, developing a **Chrome Extension** that could monitor the ratio of Homebase components to team-specific components on a page, and several **Figma Plugins** that designers used for theming and maintaining the design system. For the web library, in addition to maintaining the individual components, I also wrote **Jest** unit tests, **Cypress** integration tests, **Chromatic** visual regression tests and **Storybook** stories, and I also helped maintain our documentation site, a **Dockerized** **NextJS** app that was deployed through **Buildkite CI** with resources configured by **Terraform**.

During this time, I was also a lead for the **Trans@Wayfair ERG**. As part of this role, I was responsible for running an internal Slack channel, organizing recurring meetups, looking up documentation about company policies, and connecting employees with people from the Talent or DEI organization.
