Worked as an engineer on Fitbit's Digital Marketing team, which consisted of a mix of 8 developers and QA testers. This team maintained an ecommerce site and created splash pages based on **Photoshop** mocks for new product launches and holiday sales. **Internationalization** was an important part of this, and pages frequently had to support 5 or more languages. Designs were primarily done in **HTML** and **SCSS** and built with **Metalsmith** and **Gulp**. The team closely followed the **Scrum** methodology, had a dedicated Scrum Master and attended official training sessions.
